I was trying [asciinema](https://asciinema.org), and to test it I recorded this
video. If you want to try Haskell Stack just type this in your terminal 

<!--more-->

```bash
$ wget -qO- https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
```

or follow the install instructions on their [webpage](https://docs.haskellstack.org).

[Stack](https://asciinema.org) is a cross-platform program for developing
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) projects. You can use templates to create
new projects. In order to start a new project type:

```bash
$ stack new [name of the project] [name of the template (optional)]
```

Here you can watch it in action.
