Practicing with a FreeBSD installation as a guest operating system on
VirtualBox I found a way to make a cool animated gif, take a look.

To find a slow motion version you can go
[here](https://atmantree.keybase.pub/page/extras/install-freebsd-slowmotion.gif).

And if you want to create your own animated gif you can install
[Imagemagick](http://imagemagick.org/) and run the command:

```bash
$ convert -delay 60 -loop 0 *.jpg your-animated.gif
```
