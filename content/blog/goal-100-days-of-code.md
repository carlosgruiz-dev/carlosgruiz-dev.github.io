When I start learning bass guitar, a teacher said that if we practice like one hour a day, we will be likely to be good players very soon. As you can imagine from the title of thes post, I switched bass guitar to codding in that sentence.

Using [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com) I'm able to log my time coding and some extra data, like projects, languages, editors, and so on. What I didn't know is that I could set goals, and this is super convenient for my '#100daysOfCode'.

I set a goal for 1 hour a day except sundays. When I started I didn't have a plan, so this was a blank slate to fill it with anything I want. Since I'd no plan I needed to figure out what to do.

So I started with a pending task, update my blog. That took me something like 6 days, so a week later I was again without any idea of what to do. So, I get another 5 days more of my goal creating a web scraping script, It was super fun.

Having completed my first two week I decided to use my programming challenge to get more practies with [Scala](https://scala-lang.org). I have plenty of books and tutorials already, so the thing was where to start. Having completed a [Scala Professional Course](https://academy.lightbend.com) and studied the languege for some time, I knew kinda a lot of how it works.


## About the Goal

When I started the challenge of writing code for 100 days (except sundays), I have no idea what I was aiming for, I just knew that I 

## About the languages

So far, I tried several languages (not all programming languages),

### Markdown

As I said, not all are programming language, but when it comes about moving a blog from a static generator to anther, well, Markdown is on the way. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) have some cool features out of the box, like a great cli tool, tipical content management resources for pages, content types, shortcodes, and more. And a cool gallery of themes where I get [this one](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-noteworthy/). And of course, I use markdown for writing this post too.

### Bash and Configurations Files

Files like TOML, YAML, .config, .ini, and such don't are really about programming but getting a project running. Reacently I find handy learning more about bash scripting, to be honest I have learned my bash skills reading some shell scripts in Linux distributions, so maybe my scripts aren't optimals but they do the job. 

### Python

As I heard somebody "Python has paid me more than one chicken" hahaha.. I use and abuse Python to do a lot of stuff. And in this days I completed a webscraping script, an ETL, and some experiments like a REST API using [Cornice](https://cornice.readthedocs.io/) and [Pandas](https://cornice.readthedocs.io/) to publish data from MySQL.

### Scala

### JavaScript

### HTML / CSS
